 *
 * \brief Structure to handle the modelling of miscible or immiscible two-phase
 *        flows in a porous media.

 * The model follows what is depicted in "Finite volume approximation of a
 * diffusion-dissolution model and application to nuclear waste storage"
 * O. Angelini, C. Chavant, E. Ch√©nier, R. Eymard and S. Granet in Mathematics
 * and Computers in Simulation (2011), 81 (10), pp. 2001--2017
 *
 * Main assumptions are:
 *   - No water in the gaseous phase
 *   - Incompressibility of the liquid phase
 *   - Hydrogen pressure is given by the "perfect gas" law in the gas phase and
 *     the Henry's law in the liquid phase
 *
 * The two primitive variables are the liquid and gas pressures with a specific
 * treatment in the saturated case to handle the gas pressure (cf. the cited
 * article or Angelini's PhD thesis)
 *
 * Notations are the following :
 * - Two phases: Liquid phase denoted by "l" and gaseous phase denoted by g
 * - Two components: water denoted by w and a gaseous component (let's say
 *   hydrogen) denoted by h. The gaseous component is present in the two phases
 *   whereas water is only considered in the liquid phase.
 *
 * The resulting linear algebraic system (one applies a linearization) is
 * defined as follows:
 *
 *                         liquid   gas
 * water conservation    | M_wl  | M_wg ||P_l|   | b_w |
 *                       |-------|------||---| = |-----|
 * hydrogen conservation | M_hl  | M_hg ||P_g|   | b_h |
 *
 * This is coupled system. Coupling terms are collected inside M_wg and M_hl
